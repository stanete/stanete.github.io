Hey 🥑

Show, don't tell. My name is [David Stanete](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stanete) and I lead Software Engineering teams to build great products that add [value](/focus-on-value). I try to find simple solutions to complex and complicated problems. I've survived at many startups through different stages. People first. Extreme Programming for the win. Business and product minded. Here I just share what I learn and I usually translate my posts to Spanish too.

I'm on twitter as [@stanete](https://twitter.com/stanete). DMs are open. Check [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stanete/) too. You can also subscribe to my newsletter **With a grain of salt** and receive an email with updates from time to time.

Up next you can find out a little bit about my story (what other people call Curriculum Vitae or Resume) and what I learned along the way. I think it is a better way to express my careeer narrative. Instead of talking about what I did, I talk about what I learned.

## What I did 🚀
**💰 [Engineering Manager](/dealing-problems-scaleups), [Creditas](https://www.creditas.com/) — February 2020 - Now**

I improved my [hiring skills](/storytelling-tips-technical-interviews). I understood better how to create and lead teams and how to deal with structural problems. I also learned that some problems can’t be solved right away. I kept helping other people grow. I improved my mentoring and coaching skills. I kept growing as a leader.

**💰 [Principal Engineer](/compound-returns-engineering-excellence), [Creditas](https://www.creditas.com/) — September 2020 - January 2020**

I learned how deal with structural problems and how to solve them when I don't have full control. How to improve Engineering Excellence working with other Tech Leads and Senior Engineers. How to help other Engineers define Engineering Strategy. How to make different teams collaborate and work together. How to improve social and technical anti-patterns. I learned that leading by trying to get replaced is one of the best ways to grow.

**💰 Tech Lead, [Creditas](https://www.creditas.com/) — September 2019 - September 2020**

I learned how to lead an Engineering Team to launch new products inside a fast growing company. I understood what technical leadership means. I learned how to define Engineering Strategy that is aligned with a higher vision. How to focus on the business and make everyone understand it. How to mentor and make other Engineers grow. I realised how building an internal network with my peers helps the team I'm leading.

**🛒  Software Engineer, [Mercadona Tech](https://www.mercadonatech.es/en/) — August 2018 - August 2019**

I learned about Engineering Excellence and started to call myself a Product Minded Engineer. I discovered Extreme Programming and fell in love with it. I realised how important is to involve the whole team in the different phases of the product life cycle. I learned how to treat the processes of a team like a product. I finally understood what good Product Management and Product Design is.

**👕 Senior Android Engineer, [Chicfy](https://ww.fashionnetwork.com/news/Vinted-acquires-spanish-competitor-chicfy,1147698.html) — July 2017 - July 2018**

I learned how to deal with a lot of legacy code and how to refactor it. I understood quality is one of the best ways to go fast and I understood testing is not something optional. I learned how important CI/CD pipelines actually are. I also learned how to plan my work better despite the uncertainty. I learned how to work together with aProduct Manager and a Product Designer.

**🎥 Android Engineer, [Upclose](https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/30/upclose/) — June 2015 - June 2017**

I learned how to work in a team with a common goal. I learned about value; focus on the outcome instead of the output. We wanted to create something other people actually used. And because of this I also learned resiliency. Iteration after iteration we struggled to create a sustainable business model. I learned how to deal with uncertainty and pressure.

**🍺 Android Engineer, CervezaYa — February 2015 - September 2015**

I learned how to side hustle. I learned how to care about the business, how to create and launch a product from scratch. And how to accept failure when the market proved us wrong.

**🛠 Android Engineer, Freelance — September 2013 - June 2015**

I learned how to deal with clients and build products on my own. How to build trust with other people and how to communicate when delays happen. How to organise my time and work hard when needed. I also learned how to learn.

**🗳 Android Engineer, Indra — September 2014 - February 2015**

I learned that trying different approaches can help a team solve hard technical problems. I learned how a big consultancy firm works. I learned what bureaucracy involves for as Software Engineering team. I discovered that focusing on the outcome is much more rewarding than focusing on the output. That's why I only was there for a short period of time.

## College 🎓
I dropped out of college after the second year studying Software Engineering.

## What I know 🎼
My technical skills go through Kotlin on Spring and Android, Python on Django and Typescript on React and Node. Terraform for defining infrastructure as code. Old pen and paper for [System Design](/system-design-101). [Incident management](/incident-management). Extreme programming. TDD.

My management skills go from creating recruiting pipelines to solving deep structural problems. I do 1:1s with the people I lead and I help them progress towards their personal goals. Sometimes through [honest feedback](/feedback-canvas), coaching (not smoke) and mentoring. I work with teams to improve their processes. True agile.
