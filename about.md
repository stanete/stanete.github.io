Hey ðŸ––

Show, don't tell. My name is [David Stanete](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stanete) and I lead Software Engineering teams to build great products that add value. I try to find simple solutions to complex and complicated problems. I've survived at many startups through different stages. People first. Extreme Programming for the win. Business and product minded.  Here I just share what I learn and I usually translate my posts to Spanish too.

I'm on twitter as [@stanete](https://twitter.com/stanete). You can also subscribe to my newsletter **With a grain of salt** and receive an email with updates from time to time.
