Hey ðŸ––

My name is David Stanete and I'm a Software Engineer. I've been working mostly in tech startups with special focus on consumer products. I try to create rock SOLID, clean, testable and maintainable software.

Here I create posts for sharing thoughts and ideas about software engineering. 

I'm on twitter as [@stanete](https://twitter.com/stanete) and you can also subscribe and receive an email every time I create a new post.
